Several language schools offer a wide variety of courses. Plenty of online material 
exist to get started. It is even possible to start before you arrive in Copenhagen 
in online courses.

Some schools are paid for by the state, some have to be paid for by your employer (institute)
or yourself- which might change periodically with new tenders.

An incomplete list (alphabetically):

- [Copenhagen Language Center](https://www.kbh-sprogcenter.dk/en/)
- [Speak](https://speakspeak.dk/)
- [Studieskolen](https://www.studieskolen.dk/en)
- [UCplus](https://ucplusdansk.dk/danskkurser/)

## Online Material

### Duolingo (free)
Duolingo offers a broad range of topics and example sentences. If you use their website,
instead of their app, you can do as many exercises as you want for free **and** have 
additional explanations on the grammar. Furthermore the website-version of duolingo offers
free typing - which will force you to remember Danish a lot more than only assembling single
words to phrases. 

### Babbel
Berlin-based Babbel has - end of 2020 - a paid basic language offer for Danish. Some people
prefer their course over getting started in Duolingo. 

### Youtube

Check out [Mic's excellent playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3n_YjHL8vnARPiWuzLILuhMx0Hj-bBd) of Danish pronounciation and grammar:
