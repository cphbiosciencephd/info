## Apartment - life without basecamp

To get an apartement you need to have a CPR number 
and to get this you need to register at an address. 

To register at an address you need to live somewhere for 30 days 
or more and have permission from the flat or house owner to register at their address.

There is a housing registration document available from international house 
that needs to be filled out and signed by both you and the landlord 
and you also have to provide a receipt for the rent.
  

One way of making this work is to rent an Air BnB for a month 
where you have agreed prior to renting it that the owner 
will sign your housing registration document. 
Then you have a whole month to have a look for an apartment.

Boligportal is a good site for this. Some housing descriptions are in danish, 
but google translate seems to work well. You will also need to pay a monthly membership fee in order to write the contact the landlords. There are other sites as well, but boligportal seems to have the largest selection. 

It is also possible to ask the administration in your centre 
to send an email to employees to see if anyone knows of a spare room.
