# Copenhagen Bioscience PhD Programme 

Providing information for starting as a new PhD student from abroad in Copenhagen 
in the [Copenhagen Bioscience PhD Programme](https://cphbiosciencephd.org/) (CBPP).
 Createad as a training resource for learning git and collaborating using github.

> Please create an [issue](https://github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info/issues) if you have suggestions 
> on further content or for general changes.

## Learning Goals

- Create a [website](https://github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Render Text using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- Basic knowledge of [git](https://git-scm.com/) functionality
- Collaborating in an open source environment as described in [_A successful Git branching model_](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

> No Coding involved. Only Text

[Some slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1obZPbSLQGqbkpaRr7Y3k5K8s4NEG7rBaP9BjrbYszS0/edit?usp=sharing) used for presenting some core aspects.

## Provided Information 
- [lifex website](https://www.joinlifex.com/copenhagen/moving-to-copenhagen-denmark) on how to get started in Copenhagen
  - put into perspective what you have to do
  - give a priority of different options
- Housing ([Basecamp](_pages/basecamp.md), Housing Foundation, [Private Housing](_pages/housing_no_basecamp.md))
- Arriving as [Nordic citizen](_pages/register_nordic.md), [EU citizen](_pages/register_EU_citizen.md) and [Non-EU citizen](_pages/register_non_EU_citizen.md)
- ISM vs Borgerservice
- [banks](_pages/banks.md)
- [transportation](_pages/transportation.md), including [bikes](_pages/bikes.md)
- [furniture](_pages/furniture.md)


## Editing Hints
You can either edit online or offline using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
### Edit online an existing file on GitHub 
Without any prior setup on your local site, you can edit files directly on github, see the arrow on the screenshot below for 
[_pages/bikes.md](https://github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info/blob/master/_pages/bikes.md):

![Screenshot Editing on GitHub](edit_on_github.png)

Once you click on it, you are able to edit and preview your changes. Saving is equal to making a commit.

If you want, you can also upload a picture to 
[_pages/Figures/img_name.png](_pages/Figures) 
of yours and reference it in your page:

![Upload your Image](upload_your_image.png)

> you commit your changes to the branch you selected!

### VS Code in the browser editing 

Instead of editing in the browser using the GitHub user interface, you can also directly use
the editor VSCode in the browser:

- In [github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info..._pages/bikes.md)](https://github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info/blob/master/_pages/bikes.md) exchange the `.com` for `.dev`, i.e. [github.dev/cphbiosciencephd/info..._pages/bikes.md)](https://github.dev/cphbiosciencephd/info/blob/master/_pages/bikes.md) 

Advantages are
- have a full editor
- drag and drop files (e.g. images into folders)
- preview markdownd files (right-click on open file)
  ![Preview Markdown files](_pages/Figures/editing_vscode_preview_markdown.png)
- see file changes
  ![View file changes in VSCode](_pages/Figures/editing_vscode_diff.png)
> Changes are committed (=saved) directly. You will probably need to create a new branch using the context menu.

![create a branch in VSCode](_pages/Figures/editing_vscode_create_branch.png)

### Local file editing
- Follow the description in [setup.md](setup.md)
- Please create your own branch and then submit your changes using an pull request to the `dev`-branch

## Develop Website locally

Follow the instructions to install [**jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) locally. 
Then you can develop your pages on the fly using. However, most editors have a markdown preview function,
which is more than enough to develop your personal site.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

> Website is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

## Note on linking within the website
In order to be able to flexibly link together single sub-pages, each source 
markdown [`_page`](_page) has a permalink. This then allows to link non-nesting
sites easily together (so any website anywhere in the site-tree can be linked).
This is not super evident in the beginning, but lead to many errors during development.
Therefore:

1. each markdown document has a set permalink
  - no leading or trailing `/` (dashes)
2. to link a page in any other pages, set the full link permalink.

> See the (squashed) [commit of fixing permalinks](https://github.com/cphbiosciencephd/info/commit/07f9d12106fe7d987aa99f58885826d590c269a8) for concrete examples
